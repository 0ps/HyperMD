Still under construction... Consider:

1. Read <../README.md> if you use RequireJS
2. Read <./examples/ai1.html> if you prefer old-school HTML tags
3. Read the [source code](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD/) if you want to dive into HyperMD addons
   - VSCode is highly recommended.
   - Maybe someday the documentation will be generated with TypeScript.
